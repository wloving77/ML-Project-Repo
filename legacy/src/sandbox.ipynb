      "Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles.  It's a radical departure from classical mechanics, which governs the macroscopic world we experience daily.  Here's a breakdown of its key concepts, simplified for understanding:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Quantization:**  This is the cornerstone of quantum mechanics.  Unlike classical mechanics where energy, momentum, and other properties can take on any value, in the quantum world, these properties are *quantized*, meaning they can only exist in discrete amounts, like steps on a staircase.  Think of it like a light switch: it's either on or off, not halfway.  Similarly, an electron can only exist in specific energy levels within an atom.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Wave-Particle Duality:**  This is perhaps the most bizarre aspect. Quantum objects, like electrons and photons (light particles), exhibit properties of both waves and particles.  Sometimes they behave like waves, exhibiting interference and diffraction (like ripples in water), and other times they behave like particles, with localized position and momentum.  This isn't a matter of them *being* one or the other; they are fundamentally both.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Probability and Uncertainty:**  In classical mechanics, if you know the initial conditions of a system, you can precisely predict its future behavior.  In quantum mechanics, this is not the case.  We can only talk about the *probability* of a quantum system being in a particular state.  This is encapsulated in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely we can know certain pairs of properties, like position and momentum, simultaneously.  The more accurately we know one, the less accurately we know the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Superposition:**  A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it's measured.  Imagine a coin spinning in the air â€“ it's neither heads nor tails until it lands.  Similarly, an electron can be in a superposition of multiple energy levels until we measure its energy.  The act of measurement \"collapses\" the superposition into a single definite state.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Entanglement:**  Two or more quantum particles can become linked, regardless of the distance separating them.  This means that if you measure the property of one entangled particle, you instantly know the corresponding property of the other, even if they're light-years apart.  This seems to violate the speed of light, but it doesn't because no information is actually transmitted faster than light.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Quantum Field Theory:**  This extends quantum mechanics to include the creation and annihilation of particles.  Instead of thinking of particles as fundamental objects, quantum field theory describes them as excitations of underlying quantum fields that permeate all of spacetime.  This is the framework used to describe the Standard Model of particle physics.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In simple terms:**  Imagine the quantum world as a blurry, probabilistic place where things aren't fixed until observed, where particles behave like waves and waves like particles, and where spooky action at a distance is possible.  It's counterintuitive to our everyday experience, but it's the most accurate description we have of the universe at its smallest scales.  Understanding it fully requires advanced mathematics, but these core concepts provide a basic grasp of this fascinating and important field.\n",

Understanding the causes of adverse events and their impact on patients in robot-assisted surgery will help improve systems and operational practices to avoid incidents in the future. Methods By developing an automated natural language processing tool, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the adverse events reported to the publicly available MAUDE database (maintained by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) from 2000 to 2013. We determined the number of events reported per procedure and per surgical specialty, the most common types of device malfunctions and their impact on patients, and the potential causes for catastrophic events such as patient injuries and deaths. Results During the study period, 144 deaths (1.4% of the 10,624 reports), 1,391 patient injuries (13.1%), and 8,061 device malfunctions (75.9%) were reported. The numbers of injury and death events per procedure have stayed relatively constant (mean = 83.4, 95% confidence interval (CI), 74.2\\\\u201392.7 per 100,000 procedures) over the years. Surgical specialties for which robots are extensively used, such as gynecology and urology, had lower numbers of injuries, deaths, and conversions per procedure than more complex surgeries, such as cardiothoracic and head and neck (106.3 vs. 232.9 per 100,000 procedures, Risk Ratio = 2.2, 95% CI, 1.9\\\\u20132.6). Device and instrument malfunctions, such as falling of burnt/broken pieces of instruments into the patient (14.7%), electrical arcing of instruments (10.5%), unintended operation of instruments (8.6%), system errors (5%), and video/imaging problems (2.6%), constituted a major part of the reports. Device malfunctions impacted patients in terms of injuries or procedure interruptions. In 1,104 (10.4%) of all the events, the procedure was interrupted to restart the system (3.1%), to convert the procedure to non-robotic techniques (7.3%), or to reschedule it (2.5%). Conclusions Despite widespread adoption of robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery in the U.S., a non-negligible number of technical difficulties and complications are still being experienced during procedures. Adoption of advanced techniques in design and operation of robotic surgical systems and enhanced mechanisms for adverse event reporting may reduce these preventable incidents in the future.\", \"paper_link\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2d4a5cac38740263f7f0b81d32a2db1b6e11ef17\"}, {\"title\": \"Targeted Attacks on Teleoperated Surgical Robots: Dynamic Model-based Detection and Mitigation\", \"abstract\": \"This paper demonstrates targeted cyber-physical attacks on teleoperated surgical robots. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the robot\\'s control system to infer a critical time during surgery to drive injection of malicious control commands to the robot. We show that these attacks can evade the safety checks of the robot, lead to catastrophic consequences in the physical system (e.g., sudden jumps of robotic arms or system\\'s transition to an unwanted halt state), and cause patient injury, robot damage, or system unavailability in the middle of a surgery.

Therefore, just as we consider the safety of power plants, highways, and a variety of other engineered socio-technical systems, we must also take into account the safety of systems involving machine learning. Heretofore, the definition of safety has not been formalized in a machine learning context. In this article, we do so by defining machine learning safety in terms of risk, epistemic uncertainty, and the harm incurred by unwanted outcomes. We then use this definition to examine safety in all sorts of applications in cyber-physical systems, decision sciences, and data products. We find that the foundational principle of modern statistical machine learning, empirical risk minimization, is not always a sufficient objective. We discuss how four different categories of strategies for achieving safety in engineering, including inherently safe design, safety reserves, safe fail, and procedural safeguards can be mapped to a machine learning context. We then discuss example techniques that can be adopted in each category, such as considering interpretability and causality of predictive models, objective functions beyond expected prediction accuracy, human involvement for labeling difficult or rare examples, and user experience design of software and open data.\", \"paper_link\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f7d3f3a23c1b284a17adc93a922c56be38d221df\"}, {\"title\": \"Analysis of safety-critical computer failures in medical devices\", \"abstract\": \"Malfunctioning medical devices are one of the leading causes of serious injury and death in the US.

This paper presents a Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) based fault injection framework to assess the resilience of an open-source driving agent, called openpilot, under different environmental conditions and faults affecting sensor data. To increase the coverage of unsafe scenarios during testing, we use a strategic software fault-injection approach where the triggers for injecting the faults are derived from the unsafe scenarios identified during the high-level hazard analysis of the system. The experimental results show that the proposed strategic fault injection approach increases the hazard coverage compared to random fault injection and, thus, can help with more effective simulation of safety-critical faults and testing of AVs. In addition, the paper provides insights on the performance of openpilot safety mechanisms and its ability in timely detection and recovery from faulty inputs.\", \"paper_link\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/55401dbebc1859801be36020ea70755dab25460d\"}, {\"title\": \"A review of cognitive assistants for healthcare: Trends, prospects, and future directions\", \"abstract\": \"Paper not found or no abstract available\", \"paper_link\": \"Link not available\"}, {\"title\": \"Systems-theoretic Safety Assessment of Robotic Telesurgical Systems\", \"abstract\": null, \"paper_link\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9f69327c9f06ed2cf4f2f00e3eb5c725b0cbdaf5\"}, {\"title\": \"Reliability in application specific mesh-based NoC architectures\", \"abstract\": \"Networks on chips (NoCs) provide a mechanism for handling complex communications in the next generation of integrated circuits.
